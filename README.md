On melting and freezing for the 2d radial Stefan problem

Mahir Hadzic, Pierre Raphael
We consider the two dimensional free boundary Stefan problem describing the evolution of a spherically symmetric ice ball {r≤λ(t)}. We revisit the pioneering analysis of [20] and prove the existence in the radial class of finite time melting regimes
$$ λ(t)=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪(T−t)1/2e−2√2|ln(T−t)|√+O(1)(c+o(1))(T−t)k+12|ln(T−t)|k+12k,  k∈ℕ∗ as t→T $$
which respectively correspond to the fundamental stable melting rate, and a sequence of codimension k∈ℕ∗ excited regimes. Our analysis fully revisits a related construction for the harmonic heat flow in [42] by introducing a new and canonical functional framework for the study of type II (i.e. non self similar) blow up. We also show a deep duality between the construction of the melting regimes and the derivation of a discrete sequence of global-in-time freezing regimes
$$ λ∞−λ(t)∼⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪1logt1tk(logt)2,  k∈ℕ∗ as t→+∞ $$
which correspond respectively to the fundamental stable freezing rate, and excited regimes which are codimension k stable.
